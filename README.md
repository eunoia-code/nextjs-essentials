This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.


## Notes

As you already learned, there are some reserved filenames when working with NextJS.

Important: These filenames are only reserved when creating them inside of the app/ folder (or any subfolder). Outside of the app/ folder, these filenames are not treated in any special way.

Here's a list of reserved filenames in NextJS - you'll, of course, learn about the important ones throughout this section:

`page.js` => Create a new page (e.g., `app/about/page.js` creates a `<your-domain>/about page`)

`layout.js` => Create a new layout that wraps sibling and nested pages

`not-found.js` => Fallback page for "Not Found" errors (thrown by sibling or nested pages or layouts)

`error.js` => Fallback page for other errors (thrown by sibling pages or nested pages or layouts)

`loading.js` => Fallback page which is shown whilst sibling or nested pages (or layouts) are fetching data

`route.js` => Allows you to create an API route (i.e., a page which does NOT return JSX code but instead data, e.g., in the JSON format)

You also find a list with all supported filenames & detailed explanations in the official docs: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions
